You are building a full-stack web application using ONLY:
- React (frontend)
- Node.js + Express (backend)
No other languages or frameworks are allowed.

PROJECT GOAL:
Design and implement a modern, professional, animated educational & analytics website UI with a clean backend for course registration email handling.

The UI must look premium, not basic cards and flex only.
Use subtle professional animations (hover, scroll reveal, transitions).
No flashy or gaming effects.
